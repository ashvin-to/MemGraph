"""Core data models for BaseMem

This module defines the fundamental data structures:
- Node: Knowledge base unit with metadata (title, content, type, keywords)
- Edge: Typed relationship between two nodes with confidence scores
- Context packet: Formatted output for LLM consumption
- Retrieval result: Search result with score and source tracking

All models are Pydantic dataclasses with automatic serialization/deserialization.
Node IDs are UUIDs by default (deterministic with given seeds).
All timestamps are stored as ISO format strings.

class Node:
    """
    Represents a knowledge base unit in the graph.
    
    A node is the atomic unit of knowledge in BaseMem. It can be:
    - A concept (abstract idea)
    - A fact (concrete statement)
    - A summary (condensed information)
    - A conversation turn (AI/human message)
    
    Fields:
        id: Unique identifier (UUID4 by default, deterministic if seeded)
        title: Short label for the node (max 256 chars recommended)
        content: Full content/description (unlimited)
        node_type: Classification (see NodeType enum)
        keywords: List of tags/keywords for retrieval and linking
                 Should be curated by AI (5-10 keywords recommended)
        embedding: Vector representation for semantic search
                  None by default (can be set externally)
        weight: Importance score for ranking (0-1, affects retrieval)
               Increased when node is used in answers
        created_at: Timestamp when node was created (set automatically)
        last_accessed: Timestamp when node was last used/retrieved (updated auto)
        decay_score: Time-based decay multiplier (1.0 = no decay)
                    Decreases score for old nodes (implement manually if needed)
        metadata: Arbitrary JSON-serializable data (source, author, version, etc.)
